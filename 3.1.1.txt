Problems:
Manual transcription is tedious - During composition many ideas can be lost by the time they've been written down, as inexperienced composers may not be able to keep ideas in their head while transcribing.
Automatic transcription is multi-step - There are no clear tools out there which specifically cater to the speed of composition - recording and transcription are done separately
Multiple takes - Transcribing can be too long a process to enable multiple takes to be done one after the other
Some musicians are not formally trained - Composition can be inaccessible to those who cannot write music, especially when writing for a group
Musical education - Learning to read sheet music can be boring when you have to learn pieces that you don't want to
Automatic transcription is only easy on electronic instruments - People who only play an acoustic instrument may feel pressured to learn keyboard to transcribe their pieces, this is inefficient
Cultural heritage - Cultural music can often be lost as their is no one to pass the music down aurally or to transcribe it


Computing solutions:
Interfacing - Lilypond is a program which can turn a specific text format into PDF sheet music. My Python code can communicate with Lilypond via the modules subprocess and lilypond.
OOP - The similar qualities that all music notes share make them easily applicable to being objects, having parameters like pitch and duration
Database - The one to many relationship of Users to Pieces and Pieces to Takes means that a relational database can be easily employed to hold the data files
Signal processing - Mathematical manipulation of data to extract musical features is a powerful tool to recognise music in audio
GUI - Being able to visualise and edit music in an intuitive way is solvable by a good GUI
