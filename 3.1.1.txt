Problems:
Manual transcription is tedious - During composition many ideas can be lost by the time they've been written down, as inexperienced composers may not be able to keep ideas in their head while transcribing.
Automatic transcription is multi-step - There are no clear tools out there which specifically cater to the speed of composition - recording and transcription are done separately
Multiple takes - Transcribing can be too long a process to enable multiple takes to be done one after the other
Some musicians are not formally trained - Composition can be inaccessible to those who cannot write music, especially when writing for a group
